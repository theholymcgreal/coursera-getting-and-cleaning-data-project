# Getting and Cleaning Data
Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data uses the script run_analysis.R and:

1. Downloads the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Loads activity and feature information
3. Loads training and test datasets with columns mean and standard deviation
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, merging columns with the dataset
5. Merges two databases
6. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset with mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair
